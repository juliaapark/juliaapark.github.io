    The Defense of the Poor Image
    
</div>
        
    <div class="smalltext mt mb width50">The poor image is a copy in motion. Its quality is bad, its resolution substandard. As it accelerates, it deteriorates. It is a ghost of an image, a preview, a thumbnail, an errant idea, an itinerant image distributed for free, squeezed through slow digital connections, compressed, reproduced, ripped, remixed, as well as copied and pasted into other channels of distribution.</div>
    <div class="smalltext ml mb width50">The poor image is a rag or rip; an AVI or a JPEG, a lumpen proletarian in the class society of appearances, ranked and valued according to resolution. The poor image has been uploaded, downloaded, shared, reformatted and reedited. It transforms quality into accessibility, exhibition value into cult value, films into clips, contemplation into distraction. The image is liberated from the vaults of cinemas and archives and thrust into digital uncertainty, at the expense of its own substance. The poor image tends towards abstraction: it is a visual idea in its very becoming.</div>
    <div class="smalltext ml mb width50">The poor image is an illicit fifth-generation bastard of an original image. Its genealogy is dubious. Its filenames are deliberately misspelled. It often defies patrimony, national culture, or indeed copyright. It is passed on as a lure, a decoy, an index, or as a reminder of its former visual self. It mocks the promises of digital technology. Not only is it often degraded to the point of being just a hurried blur, one even doubts whether it could be called an image at all. Only digital technology could produce such a dilapidated image in the first place.</div>
    <div class="smalltext">Poor images are the contemporary Wretched of the Screen, the debris of audiovisual production, the trash that washes up on the digital economies’ shores. They testify to the violent dislocation, transferrals, and displacement of images their acceleration and circulation within the vicious cycles of audiovisual capitalism. Poor images are dragged around the globe as commodities or their effigies, as gifts or as bounty. They spread pleasure or death threats, conspiracy theories or bootlegs, resistance or stultification. </div>


    <div class="mediumtext mt mb">Low Resolutions</div>
    <div class="smalltext mt">Focus is identified as a class position, a position of ease and privilege, while being out of focus lowers one's value as an image.
    In flagship stores high-end products are marketed in an upscale environment. More affordable derivatives of the same images circulate as DVDs, on broadcast television or online, as poor images.
    The insistence upon analog film as the sole medium of visual importance resounded throughout discourses on cinema, almost regardless of their ideological inflection. It never mattered that these high-end economies of film production were (and still are) firmly anchored in systems of national culture, capitalist studio production, the cult of mostly male genius, and the original version, and thus are often conservative in their very structure. Resolution was fetishized as if its lack amounted to castration of the author. The cult of film gauge dominated even independent film production. The rich image established its own set of hierarchies, with new technologies offering more and more possibilities to creatively degrade it.
    </div>

    <div class="mediumtext mt mb">Resurrection as Poor Images</div>
    <div class="smalltext mt">Twenty or even thirty years ago, the neoliberal restructuring of media production began slowly obscuring non-commercial imagery, to the point where experimental and essayistic cinema became almost invisible.

        This development was of course connected to the neoliberal radicalization of the concept of culture as commodity, to the commercialization of cinema, its dispersion into multiplexes, and the marginalization of independent filmmaking. It was also connected to the restructuring of global media industries and the establishment of monopolies over the audiovisual in certain countries or territories. In this way, resistant or non-conformist visual matter disappeared from the surface into an underground of alternative archives and collections, kept alive only by a network of committed organizations and individuals, who would circulate bootlegged VHS copies amongst themselves.
        
        Clandestine cell-phone videos smuggled out of museums are broadcast on YouTube. DVDs of artists’ viewing copies are bartered. Many works of avant-garde, essayistic, and non-commercial cinemas have been resurrected as poor images. 
        Whether they like it or not.
        </div>

    <div class="mediumtext mt mb">Privatisation and Piracy</div>
    <div class="smalltext mt">Poor images are poor because they are not assigned any value within the class society of images – their stats as illicit or degraded grants them exemption from its criteria. Their lack of resolution attests to their appropriation and displacement.
        Privatization of media production gradually grew more important than state controlled/sponsored media production. But, on the other hand, the rampant privatization of intellectual content, along with online marketing and commodification, also enable piracy and appropriation; it gives rise to the circulation of poor images.
        </div>

    <div class="mediumtext mt mb">Imperfect Cinema</div>
    <div class="smalltext mt">The imperfect cinema is one that strives to overcome the divisions of labour within class society. It merges art with life and science, blurring the distinction between consumer and producer, audience and author. It insists upon its own imperfection, is popular but not consumerist, committed without becoming bureaucratic.
        Like the economy of poor images, imperfect cinema diminished the distinctions between author and audience and merges life and art. 
        
        The networks in which poor images circulate thus constitute both a platform for a fragile new common interest and a battleground for commercial and national agendas… While it enables the users’ active participation in the creation and distribution of content, it also drafts them into production. Users become the editors, critics, translators, and (co-)authors of poor images… Poor images are thus popular images – images that can be made and seen by the many… Poor images are poor because they are heavily compressed and travel quickly. They lose matter and gain speed. 
        In a way, the poor image is subject to a similar tension. On the one hand, it operates against the fetish value of high resolution. On the other hand, this is precisely why it also ends up being perfectly integrated into an information capitalism thriving on compressed attention spans, on impression rather than immersion, on intensity rather than contemplation, on previews rather than screenings.
        </div>

    <div class="mediumtext mt mb">Comrade, what is your visual bond today?</div>
    <div class="smalltext mt">The poor image thus constructs anonymous global networks just as it creates a shared history… The circulation of poor images thus creates “visual bonds”…link{ing} the workers of the world with each other…there is also the circulation and production of poor images based on cell phone cameras, home computers, and unconventional forms of distribution. Its optical connections – collective editing, file sharing, or grassroots distribution circuits – reveal erratic and coincidental links between producers everywhere, which simultaneously constitute dispersed audiences.
    The poor image embodies the afterlife of many former masterpieces of cinema and video art. IT has been expelled from the sheltered paradise that cinema seems to have once been. After being kicked out of the protected and often protectionist arena of national culture, discarded from commercial circulation, these works have become travellers in a digital no-man’s land, constantly shifting their resolution and format, speed and media, sometimes even losing names and credits along the way.
    </div>

    <div class="largetext mt">NOW!</div>
<div class="smalltext mt">Now many of these works are back – as poor images, I admit. One could of course argue that this is not the real thing, but then – please, anybody – show me this real thing. 
    The poor image is no longer about the real thing – the originary original. Instead, it is about its own real conditions of existence: about swarm circulation, digital dispersion, fractured and flexible temporalities. It is about defiance and appropriation just as it is about conformism and exploitation.
    In short: it is about reality.
